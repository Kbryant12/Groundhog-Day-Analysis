# Groundhog-Day-Analysis
Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between Groundhog Day's shadow presence and the February temperature. By analyzing historical data, we seek to understand if there's a correlation between the two variables.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from archive.csv. It contains records related to Groundhog Day observations, including shadow presence and February average temperatures.

Project Structure
Data Import and Cleaning: The initial phase involves importing the dataset and performing necessary data cleaning tasks such as renaming columns and handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, were created to understand the distribution and relationship between the variables.

Statistical Analysis: A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to quantify the relationship between February temperature and shadow presence.

Visualizations
Bar Plot: Shows the average February temperature categorized by shadow presence.

Scatter Plot: Represents the relationship between Groundhog Day shadow presence and February temperature.

Box Plot: Displays the distribution of February temperatures based on shadow presence categories.

Key Findings
The correlation coefficient between February temperature and shadow presence is approximately -0.20, indicating a weak negative relationship.

The visualizations suggest that there's little difference in the February temperatures based on shadow presence categories.

Conclusion
While this analysis provides insights into the relationship between Groundhog Day shadow presence and February temperatures, no significant correlation was observed in the dataset. The results contribute to our understanding of the factors influencing this annual event and emphasize the importance of data-driven approaches in such studies.
